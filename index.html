			<p>My parents immigrated to the US from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi">New Delhi</a>, India. I was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_View,_California">Mountain View</a> and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose,_California">San Jose</a>, California.</p> 

			<p>I attended <a href="bcp.org">Bellarmine College Preparatory</a> in San Jose from 2017 to 2021 and spent most of high school thinking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy_debate">policy debate</a>. I graduated as salutatorian from Bellarmine in 2021 and matriculated to the <a href="https://sfs.georgetown.edu/">School of Foreign Service</a> at <a>Georgetown University</a>. I stumbled around for two years in a college designed to train diplomats, mostly taking courses in international relations, math, and economics</p>
