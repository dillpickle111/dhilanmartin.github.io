        <h3>Hi, I'm Dhilan.</h3>

        <p>My parents immigrated to the U.S. from Cape Town and London. I was born in New York and raised in Los Angeles.</p>

        <p>I've always liked figuring out how things work. I built my first PC when I was nine, and by eleven I was building them for friends. That curiosity has guided everything I've done since.</p>

        <p>At <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyola_High_School_(Los_Angeles)">Loyola High School</a>, I served as Class President and helped manage a <b>$1.3 million scholarship portfolio</b> as part of the <b>Student Investment Fund</b>. These experiences gave me an early glance at what real responsibility feels like—when decisions have numbers, names, and real outcomes attached.</p>

        <p>As an upperclassman, I wanted to create something that would last beyond me. I wanted to sustain a program for generations to come. That's how my <a href="tomfoolery/compost.jpg">Composting Program</a> started.</p>

        <p>Two years later, we've composted over <b>10,000 lbs of waste</b> and brought in more than <b>200 students</b>. It's now the first fully student-led, on-site high school composting program in the country.</p>

        <p>Aristotle once said, "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit." Sustainability works the same way—not as a trend, but as a daily habit that adds up for the future generations' reward.</p>

        <p>I like <a href="tomfoolery/music.jpg">music</a>, <a href="tomfoolery/cooking.jpg">cooking</a>, and <a href="tomfoolery/golf.jpg">golf</a>—a sport that is deceptively simple and endlessly complicated, reflecting life in every swing.</p>
