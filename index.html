			<p>My parents immigrated to the US from New Delhi, India. I was born in Mountain View and raised in San Jose, California.</p> 

			<p>I attended Bellarmine College Preparatory in San Jose from 2017 to 2021 and spent most of high school thinking about policy debate. I graduated as salutatorian from Bellarmine in 2021 and matriculated to the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University. I stumbled around for two years, mostly taking courses in international relations, math, and economics, before going on leave in 2023.</p>

			<p>During college, I was an Assistant Debate Coach at Bellarmine, an Intern at the Brookings Institution under Eswar Prasad, and a Research Assistant to Caitlin Talmadge in the Security Studies program at Georgetown.</p>

			<p>I went on leave in 2023 to work full-time on <a href="https://mercor.io">Mercor</a>.</p>
