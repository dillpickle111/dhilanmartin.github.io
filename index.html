	<h1>Hi, I'm Surya.</h1>
	<h3>And I realize this website is pretty simple.</h3>
	<p>
		Five reasons:
		<ol>
			<li>Believe me when I say I know a little bit of CSS and what Bootstrap is. I'm just tired of fancy websites with irritating scrolling that doesn't really work properly.</li>
			<li>Plus, I do love me some <a href="http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/">Warren Buffett</a>.</li>
			<li>And, does anyone still visit this wesbite? I don't think I'm important enough for people to consciously want to seek out information about me.</li>
			<li>Also, I'm sick of trying to get hamburger menus to work when I don't have anything interesting enough to fill up a page, let alone multiple pages.</li>
			<li>Finally, the most important reason: <b>I'm too lazy to put actual work into this page</b>.</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<h3>Who am I and why should I care about you?</h3>
	<p>I really don't have an answer to that question. I ask myself that all the time.</p> 
	<p><i>I don't know if I was just blunt, deep, edgy, or some cringeworthy combination of all three.</i></p>
	<h3>Anyway, since you're here.</h3>
	<p>Follow me on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/suryamidha/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/suryamidha">Twitter</a> for more edgy content.</p>
