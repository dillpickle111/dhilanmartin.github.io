        <h3>Hi, I'm Dhilan.</h3>

        <p>My parents immigrated to the U.S. from Cape Town and London. I was born in New York and raised in Los Angeles.</p>

        <p>I've always liked figuring out how things work. I built my first PC when I was nine, and by eleven I was building them for friends. That curiosity has guided everything I've done since.</p>

        <p>At <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyola_High_School_(Los_Angeles)">Loyola High School</a>, as a dual-sport athlete, I served as Class President, led multiple Clubs, and managed a <b>$1.3 million scholarship portfolio</b> as part of the <b>Student Investment Fund</b>. These roles taught me that leadership isn't about the position you hold, but the people your choices affect.</p>

        <p>As an upperclassman, I wanted to create something that would last beyond me. I wanted to sustain a program for generations to come. That's why I led design on a school-wide <a href="tomfoolery/compost.jpg">Composting Program</a>.</p>

        <p>Two years later, we've composted over <b>10,000 lbs of waste</b> and brought in more than <b>200 student volunteers</b>. It's now the first fully student-led, on-site high school composting program in the California.</p>

        <p>What started as a simple idea has grown into something much bigger. Every day, students make the choice to compost instead of throwing awayâ€”small actions that compound into meaningful change. That's how real impact happens: not through grand gestures, but through consistent, everyday decisions that add up over time.</p>

        <p>Looking back on these years, I realize the best changes happen when you stop trying to be impressive and start trying to be useful. That's what I want to bring to college and beyond.</p>

        <p>I like <a href="tomfoolery/music.jpg">music</a>, <a href="tomfoolery/cooking.png">cooking</a>, <a href="tomfoolery/golf.jpg">golf</a>, and web design.</p>
