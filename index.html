        <h3>Hi, I'm Dhilan.</h3>

        <p>My parents immigrated to the U.S. from Cape Town and London. I was born in New York and raised in Los Angeles.</p>

        <p>I've always liked figuring out how things work. I built my first PC when I was nine, and by eleven I was building them for friends. That curiosity has guided everything I've done since.</p>

        <p>At <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyola_High_School_(Los_Angeles)">Loyola High School</a>, as a dual-sport athlete, I served as Class President, led multiple Clubs, and managed a <b>$1.3 million scholarship portfolio</b> as part of the <b>Student Investment Fund</b>. These experiences gave me an early glance at what real responsibility feels like—when decisions have numbers, names, and real outcomes attached.</p>

        <p>As an upperclassman, I wanted to create something that would last beyond me. I wanted to sustain a program for generations to come. That's why I led design on a school-wide <a href="tomfoolery/compost.jpg">Composting Program</a>.</p>

        <p>Two years later, we've composted over <b>10,000 lbs of waste</b> and brought in more than <b>200 student volunteers</b>. It's now the first fully student-led, on-site high school composting program in the country.</p>

        <p>What started as a simple idea has grown into something much bigger. Every day, students make the choice to compost instead of throwing away—small actions that compound into meaningful change. That's how real impact happens: not through grand gestures, but through consistent, everyday decisions that add up over time.</p>

        <p>I like <a href="tomfoolery/music.jpg">music</a>, <a href="tomfoolery/cooking.jpg">cooking</a>, <a href="tomfoolery/golf.jpg">golf</a>, and web design.</p>
