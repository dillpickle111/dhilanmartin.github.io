### Made for People
[Made for people](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/made-for-people/id1116879925) is a podcast that explores complex ideas and explains them for thoughtful and intelligent dinner table conversations. **There are no stupid questions.** I made this podcast because I felt that there was a huge group of people who were too scared to ask even the most basic questions out of fear of being though of as dumb or stupid. I felt that through the medium of a podcast, I could answer these questions in a way that people could understand in an accessible way.
